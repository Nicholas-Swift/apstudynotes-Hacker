    Increase the pressure in my bow-arm. Bring the bow closer to the bridge to get a resonant sound. Pull the bow while keeping all my weight in my shoulder. Build up the slow pulsation to a swift vibrato. It is all of these motions and thoughts that lead to one beautiful note that can resonate throughout a whole room,. Playing the cello requires a disciplined mind, and I believe my musical history has influenced my lifetime goal of becoming an accountant.


    Most children have dreamt of becoming the President or a princess at least once in their life. For me, it was slightly different. I never had a definitive job that I saw myself doing, and it was not until I met an accountant in my church that I ever considered the possibility of becoming one. The accountant, Robert, told me that his job allows him to meet an assortment of people everyday but he also gets time to himself. His job requires him to work with a team, but everyone has their own duty. After pondering his words, I realized that much of what I do now in one day is similar to one day as an accountant


    Every day of high school, so far, I have gone to orchestra. Although an orchestra is comprised of individual players, each player has their own duty to go home and practice on their own time. For me, this only became a struggle in high school because I started to receive much more work than in middle school. Despite the workload, I still make time everyday to practice, and in order to practice I have to manage my time wisely. If I do not do my part as a cellist, I am affecting the whole orchestra. As first chair, I will only hurt my section if I come to class unprepared. And just as the cello section depends on me, I depend on them to contribute equally. Not only does orchestra allow me to interact with students of all different ages, it allows me to be a leader.


    While orchestra is a large part of my high school career, my coursework is my most important undertaking and it will be a priority in college. Having multiple Pre AP or AP classes in one year can be intimidating. Every class requires careful attention and dedication. For me, I allot several hours for doing schoolwork and studying. I can easily just watch TV or sleep, but my schoolwork will still taunt me afterwards. As an accountant, I will have many clients to assist everyday. Some will be more demanding than others, but that does not mean I will give diminished focus to the less demanding clients. Every person deserves my best work just as an in high school every class deserves the same effort. Also, two activities that benefit me as a student are calendars and planning. If I have a AP English test and an AP Environmental Science test on the same day, I allot significant focus to the AP Environmental Science due to it being a more time-consuming class for me. To further my focus, I start studying for the science test several days in advance. As an accountant, deadlines are an important thing. I will promise my client that I will have transactions ready by a certain time. Some transactions will be more complex so I will have to start them a few days earlier than other transactions due the same day.


    Students often feel pressured to know exactly what they want to do in their life. As soon as senior year starts, the badgering about college majors will start. Then when you get to college, the career questions start. Although my experience was no different, I never expected to realize my dream job in a conversation with a church friend. Accountants are entrusted with the financial aspects of a client’s life. By no means is the job easy. It can be stressful much of the time, but I believe that my high school career will lead me to success in the field. High school was a time for me to learn the art of discipline and prioritizing, and I fully plan on doing this throughout college. So although the accounting field contains many desirable aspects, to me the valuable thing is that I can provide confidence to people about their finances. To me, there is no better feeling in the world than seeing that my aid helps someone else succeed.

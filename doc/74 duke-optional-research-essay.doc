My experience designing websites and Internet
applications landed me a job as a Webmaster for Intel Corporation this past
summer. I had the opportunity to work for Intel’s CIO on the development of an
Intranet Video Channel to improve employee communication and productivity. My
task was to research the viability of using web video, a la YouTube, as a
medium for the company management to communicate with employees more
efficiently than the current methods of email and blogging.


I presented a proposal for three possible
methods of building an internal video infrastructure. I conducted a thorough
test of each method, and presented my findings to the IT Communications
Department. The solution I recommended was the one that was eventually chosen.
Not only was it the most economical solution for Intel but it was
straightforward and utilized existing workstations and servers. The system
would use Adobe Flash Video technology combined with advanced server-side
scripting and a Cisco Content Distribution Network to ensure speedy downloads
for all of Intel's employees, local and international. The final project
documentation, which I wrote, was 21 pages including graphical aids. My
eight-week internship at Intel not only exposed me to the high-tech industry,
but it helped me to develop critical business knowledge and technical skills
which I’ve put to use in my many endeavors.

What matters to you, and why? (250 word limit.)


 


One thing that bears great importance to me is that those who cannot otherwise provide safety and security for themselves are given the appropriate help. To me, this matter manifested itself in the form of animals. Ever since I was little, my life was filled with the abandoned, the left behind, the mistreated, the rescued. With a local SPCA chapter, my mother and I took on litters of kitties to foster. I remember the first litter we brought home. I remember watching the litters grow up, turning from helpless, damaged creatures into busy, self-sufficient adults. I remember the first pet fair I attended. I remember the first adoption, the initial sorrow from losing contact, and the burst of joy from hearing back from the new owner, knowing that I had helped this animal to achieve happiness and security.


Rescue animals reinserted itself into my life once again five years ago, when I stumbled upon a litter of abandoned kittens, struggling to survive. It would be one of the most rewarding experiences watching these once frail, fraught animals transform into vigorous beings. My effort to raise these kittens would be repaid in full with their affection and lovable quirkiness. After all, what more is there to ask for from a living being? All beasts should be able to display their full personalities - it is their right as living creatures. Unlocking that potential is the sole motivation for my role as a nurturer.

I am Chopin. Preparing to strike the G in Chopin’s Sonata No. 3, I let myself melt and mold into the greatest performer of this piece–Chopin himself.

A female pianist can only exert so much force before her muscles stress out and catapult the performance to an unfortunate end. However, when I become Prokofiev, my power is unbounded.

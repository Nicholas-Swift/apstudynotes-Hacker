Although you may not yet know what you want to major in, which department or program at MIT appeals to you and why?


I am very attracted to the opportunity to explore the offerings at MIT’s Mathematics and Physics Departments. Mathematics and physics have been my academic passions ever since I entered high school. Therefore, I am confident that my academic interests will involve those fields. I am fascinated by how mathematics and physics interact. Something that appeals to me is that, in today’s world, these fields are as “practical” as engineering or business. I am especially interested in understanding the language of physics and mathematics as they are reflected in the workings of the universe and their applications to the modern world.

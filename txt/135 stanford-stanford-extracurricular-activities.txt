Please briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences. (150 word limit.)


Key Club is not simply another community service organization, it is my high school family. Key Club spurs excitement within me as it represents a tolerant organization that brings positive change through community service events and fundraisers. My commitment to Key Club increased as I gained the position of Club President within my home club. My shy shell of a self cracked as soon as I began hosting weekly meetings and workshop presentations, impacting me with improvements in public speaking  and presenting information to a wide group of people—important for my future career interest in research and teaching. Not only did I find confidence through these experiences, but I improved my organizational skills in planning club meetings, service events, and fundraisers. With all these events under my plate, I also learned to grasp diverse groups of people and their distinctive personalities, ultimately allowing me to become more tolerant and accepting.

After a long school day, I frequently come home and rush straight to my piano, where I close my eyes and play out my emotions. But though I have been playing traditional piano for ten years, you will be hard-pressed to find me churning out a vigorous Chopin etude for fun; instead, my greatest joy comes from improvising covers of my favorite popular songs. When I am feeling down, playing Akon cheers me up. In my mischievous moods, I channel Billy Talent into the keys. Catch me in my happiest hour, and I am found swaying on a piano bench, eyes closed, arms loose, blasting Matt and Kim's Daylight through the house. I seem to live in a world overly concerned with certainties, and I am just glad I have music in my life to unwind, to express myself through songs I love. No sheet music, no pressure, no limitations.

<p>Evaluate a significant experience, achievement, risk you have taken, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you.</p><p>I told him that it was like aliens. Like flying saucers. Like Star Wars. Like
Transformers. But no matter what analogy I made, the little boy standing in front of me
could not grasp the concept of science fiction.
</p><p>“Does that mean you can’t shrink this?” The little boy revealed a small, green
HotWheels car from his pocket. “Mrs. Frizzle can shrink her bus so small it swims in
your blood, and you guys can’t shrink this? This car is way too big for my ants to drive!”
</p><p>He stared at me with sincere and confused eyes, and it pained me, knowing that I
would be the source of this young boy’s disillusionment. I knelt down to meet him at eye
level. “I’m sorry dude, but the Magic School Bus is science fiction,” I responded. “It’s
science fiction. It isn’t real life.”
</p><p>Of all of my moments working as a salesman at Geppetto’s, a local toy store, this
one was both the most memorable and most significant to my life. While the little boy
eventually realized his quest for ant-sized cars was futile, his whimsical notions of
miniature transportation and intravascular travel lingered in my mind. I pictured tiny
submarines being driven alongside bacteria, and wondered why technology had yet to
conquer the microscopic realm. How come humans, I contemplated, who have the
intellectual capacity to send a spacecraft millions of miles to Mars, have yet to send an
explorer into our own human bodies?
</p><p>In my determined search for answers, I scoured through the Internet and my AP
Biology textbook for information about transportation at the molecular level. Through
this, I discovered many different ways a nanosized vessel could be propelled, such as
flagella (twisting tails) or microfilaments (like train tracks within cells). Still, I was
stumped as to why tiny machines were not currently swimming in my veins.
</p><p>I acted on my curiosity and sought out an internship at the Department of
Nanoengineering at UCSD under Professor Joseph Wang. I approached the internship
expecting to simply acquire a few insights on the mechanics of bacterial and cellular
movement. Instead, I was exposed to a whole new world of science. Comparing life as
we perceive it with life in the nanosized world, I learned, is tantamount to comparing the
Earth to the moon. In the realm of the nanomotor, water molecules become magnetic BB
gun pellets that push and pull randomly in a process known as Brownian motion. Low
Reynolds number makes moving through air or water feel like wading through honey.
And any usable momentum? Forget about it. Inertial properties are so minimized that
nanomotors are either accelerating or stopped. </p><p>Through my research, I was able to delve into this exotic world. Because
nanoengineering is still a budding field, many of the specifics of motion and dynamics at
the nanoscale are unknown. Thus, when I was assigned to a project designing and testing
bubble-propelled microjets, I felt as if I was exploring a previously undiscovered realm.
</p><p>My first days of laboratory experience were both exciting and nerve-racking.
Producing and testing nanowires while sporting a UCSD lab coat and purple nitrile
gloves made me feel like a pioneer on an ambitious search for answers. However, since I
was working with scholars that already had several years of nanoengineering experience,
I generally had little confidence in my own ideas and opinions. During our first project
meeting, however, I found inspiration in the form of children. I remembered that while
coaching a third and fourth grade basketball team and working at Geppetto’s, many of the
suggestions and ideas of the kids were, despite a certain level of simplicity, still very
interesting and thought provoking to me. Applying this to myself, I felt compelled to ask
many questions and express my thoughts and opinions, however simplistic they were,
during this first meeting. As a result, many of my ideas ended up being implemented into
the final experiment, including an idea of mine regarding a method for etching grooves
on a silver wire, which was eventually introduced as a crucial step in the procedure for
producing these bubble-propelled microjets. Thus, I evolved from an explorer to an early
settler, helping to set the foundations of a new world.
</p><p>Nanotechnology is still in its nascent stages. Nevertheless, it is progressing at a
rapid rate, and I am certain that its unbelievable potential applications will manifest
themselves in the near future. It could save lives; imagine cancer-seeking missiles
rocketing through your body or microscopic capsules that release insulin upon detection
of high blood sugar. Environmental concerns could be quelled with water-purifying
nanomachines and oil-consuming robots to clean disastrous oil spills. Even more
intriguing is the notion of accelerated evolution, in which the structure organic molecules,
such as enzymes or DNA, could be edited very precisely and specifically. I can almost
hear the doctor saying, “You have a family history of sickle-cell anemia? No problem,
I’ll just send these little guys over to your blastocyst to check it out and fix it if needed.”
</p><p>And to think, all my interest in nanoengineering was spurred by the simple
question of a little boy, a boy I have not seen since our one and only encounter at
Geppetto’s. He came to me with imagination and vision, and I turned him away citing the
falseness of science fiction. If only I could tell him what I have learned. That I have
witnessed first hand the bizarre physics of an alien world. That I have contributed to the
first steps of conquering a foreign field. That I have seen glimpses into the advanced,
robot-filled future. If I ever see him again, I will tell him: through the unlimited creativity
and curiosity of man, even science fiction can one day converge with reality.</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/common-app/">Common App admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/common-app/the-pub/" title='Prev: "The Pub"'>Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/common-app/alcohol-s-daughter-1/" title="Next: Alcohol's Daughter">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p>This essay comes from AdmitSphere who kindly allowed it to be republished here.</p><p class="randomquote"><q>An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Benjamin Franklin</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

<p>            While looking through my stacks of pictures, I realize
how important the memories in my all-school photos are to me.  One particular picture, from ninth grade, is
especially significant not because I like to look at what my classmates or
teachers looked like, but because it reminds me of how much my life has changed
since the beginning of high school.  For
years, school has been a part of almost everything I do and, except perhaps for
my parents, has shaped my future more than anything else.  High school has not been the only cause of
change for me in the last three years, but it played a pivotal role.  Not only did school teach me math, English,
and lots of other subjects, but it also changed my outlook on life in ways I
now realize aren’t immediately obvious, even to me.<br/></p><p>            When this picture was taken, the only real activity I did
after school, other than homework and my own projects, was tutoring other
students once a week.  As with almost
everything at my school at that time, the tutoring program was disorganized
(the school was new then), but that didn’t matter, and I found it particularly
enjoyable to know that I was helping other people.  While I’ve never had problems with classes,
it frustrates me to see others fail, and I like to help them whenever
possible.  To this day I still tutor
students after school, and not only is the tutoring program better than it once
was, but my tutoring skills have improved as well.</p><p>            While I’ve continued with student tutoring, since my
ninth grade picture was taken I’ve also expanded my horizons by starting an
Electronics Club.  For several years now
I’ve wanted to start such a club because of my own interest in building
gadgets, and because I thought other students might be interested too.  My club has only had a few meetings, and only
has a few members, but people are coming back for more, even though I don’t
think I’ve been making the meetings as interesting as I could have.  My hope is that I’ll not only be able to
teach club members the basic theories behind electronic design, but also
introduce them to my own interests, so that they’ll consider electronics not
only as a hobby, but also as a possible career.</p><p>            Of course, school is only part of life.  While I may not immediately associate a school
picture with what I’ve done outside of school, especially with my own
interests, the principle of looking back to see what has changed still
applies.  For years, I’ve focused some of
my own time on designing and building electronic devices.  In ninth grade, I was still finishing what
was, at the time, the most complex project I’d done, an odd radio-controlled
device designed to fill the neighborhood water tank, which is useful at my
house because I live beyond the reaches of the city water system.  I personally never thought that the device
worked too well, though the neighbors were impressed.  Now, while I’m still working on plans for a
better version, and while I realize that I have more experience now, I still look
back and wonder, “Why did I do it that way?”</p><p>            At the time the picture was taken, although I did
projects for the neighborhood, I was not very involved with the greater
community.  Since then, I’ve realized
that helping the community can be much more than simply fulfilling a school
requirement.  So, while history has never
been my favorite subject, I decided to assist the docents at the local history
museum both because I knew the museum needed help and because I really did want
to know more about the history of where I live—an area on the central coast of
California once dominated by loggers and short-lived boom towns.  While working at a museum is not always
entertaining, it is both fascinating to see the old photographs and rewarding
to know that the history of the area will not be lost.  Looking back through the binders of old
photos is especially interesting because the pictures show how much has changed
since the days of horses and buggies, just as my school picture shows how much
has changed for me since the beginning of high school.</p><p>            A picture is simply a snapshot of one instant, but a
stack of pictures can, like a movie, describe the progression of my life.  And, as I said before, I mainly look at these
pictures not because I want to see what my friends or my teachers looked like
then, but for the memories of what has happened and changed in my life
since.  When I consider the array of
pictures as a whole, it becomes even clearer how much I’ve learned and changed,
and on closer inspection, how much of this was because, directly or indirectly,
of my generally excellent school experience.</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/stanford/">Stanford admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/stanford/clam-bake/" title='Prev: Describe a Person who has Influenced Your Life - "Grandma"'>Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/stanford/stanford-ms-in-computer/" title="Next: Stanford MS in Computer Science">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>Data is not information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not understanding, understanding is not wisdom.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Clifford Stoll</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!
